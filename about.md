# Learning about {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}
{: #about}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service to route platform logs that are generated by selected {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instances to your chosen destination (target).
{: shortdesc}

For more information, see [About platform logs](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-about-platform-logs).


To configure platform logs, you must configure tenants and targets (destinations) in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

{{site.data.content.tenant_definition-paragraph}}




## Tenants
{: #about_tenants}


When you manage tenants, consider the following information:

- You must create a tenant in your account in each region where you want to use {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} to collect and route platform logs.

    Each region is independent.

    Regions do not share data.

- When you create a tenant, you must define 1 target destination. For more information, see [Creating a tenant](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-tenant-create).

- When you update a tenant, you can only modify the name of the tenant.
- When you delete a tenant, you also delete the target definitions. If you want to delete a target destination instance, you must delete the instance separately.
- You can list all the tenants in an account by using the `GET /tenants` API method.
- To get the details about a tenant, you can use the `GET /tenants/{tenant_id}` API method specifying the tenant ID returned when listing the tenants in an account.

You can also see the configured tenants and target destinations using the [routing configuration UI](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-launch-ui).

## Targets
{: #about_targets}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} supports {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instances targets.

Only public ingress endpoints are supported when configuring a target to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.
{: restriction}

For more information, see [Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service to route platform logs to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-target-cloud-logs).



The {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} target instance can be located in the same account, a different account, and the same or different region as the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} tenant.
{: important}

When you manage targets, consider the following information:



- You can update the target configuration details such as target host, target port, target name, target instance CRN, and more.



- You can list all the targets in a tenant by using the `GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/targets` API method.

- To get the details about a target by using the `GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/targets/{target_id}` API method.

You can also see the configured tenants and target destinations using the [routing configuration UI](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-launch-ui).
{: tip}

Authorization between the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service and the target destination instances is done through IAM.




## Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}
{: #about_connecting}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}} provides API endpoints for  management functions, such as creating or managing a tenant configuration. These API endpoints are endpoints are accessed by using region-specific URLs. You can find the endpoints for each supported region [here](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-endpoints).

You can manage {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} by using the management API. The management API supports either a public endpoint or a private endpoint. A public endpoint can be reached over the internet, whereas a private endpoint can be accessed only from within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network.



Through the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} UI, you can create a tenant in a region by using the public network.

The {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}} supports the following types of endpoints to privately connect to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}:
- {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Cloud Service Endpoint (CSE)
- {{site.data.keyword.vpe_full}}.

If you are connecting from an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can connect by using either a CSE or {{site.data.keyword.vpe_short}}. For more information, see [Using virtual private endpoints for VPC to privately connect to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-vpe-connection&interface=api).

If you are connecting from a system that is not contained in an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, your only private endpoint option is to connect by using a CSE. Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} by using a CSE might not require any additional work on your part. Access to CSEs is only available from within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. For more information, see [Using service endpoints to privately connect to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-service-endpoints).

You can only access the [{{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} UI](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-launch-ui) through the public network.
