# Learning about {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}
{: #about}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service to route platform logs that are generated by selected {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instances to your chosen destination (target).
{: shortdesc}

For more information, see [About platform logs](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-about-platform-logs).


To configure platform logs, you must configure tenants and targets (destinations) in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

## Tenants
{: #about_tenants}


When you manage tenants, consider the following information:

- You must create a tenant in your account in each region where you want to use {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} to collect and route platform logs.

    Each region is independent.

    Regions do not share data.

- When you create a tenant, you must define 1 target destination. For more information, see [Creating a tenant](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-tenant-create).
- You can define up to 2 target destinations per target. The targets must be of different type.
- When you update a tenant, you can modify the name of the tenant only.
- When you delete a tenant, you also delete the target definitions. If you want to delete a target destination instance, you must delete the instance separately.
- You can list all the tenants in an account by using the `v1/tenants` route.
- To get the details of a tenant, the route accepts a query parameter name to return details of the named tenant.

## Targets
{: #about_targets}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} supports {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instances targets.

Only public ingress endpoints are supported when configuring a target to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.
{: restriction}

For more information, see [Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service to route platform logs to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-target-cloud-logs).



The {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} target instance can be located in the same account, a different account, and the same or different region as the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} tenant.
{: important}

When you manage targets, consider the following information:

- When you create a target, you can only add 1 target.

    When tenant is created, at least one target has to be specified. You can only define 2 targets per tenant. Therefore, you can only add 1 target to an existing tenant. {: note}

    The target name must be unique within the region and not exceed 35 characters in length. If you attempt to create a target with a name that already exists within the region or is too long, an error is returned and your target is not created.
    {: note}

- You can update the target configuration details such as target host, target port, target name, target instance CRN, and more.

- You can delete only 1 target from a tenant.

- You can list all the targets in a tenant by using the `v1/tenants/tenantID/targets` route.

- To get the details of a target, the route accepts a query parameter name to return details of the named target.



Authorization between the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service and the target destination instances is done through IAM.
